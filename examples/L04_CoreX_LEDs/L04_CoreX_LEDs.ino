/**************************************************
 * L04_CoreX_LEDs.ino
 * An example program to demonstrate how to use the LEDs built into the CoreX controller.
 * The built in LEDs are RGB Neo Pixels.  These provide a full range of colors and are
 * convenient to use from Arduino.
 *
 * The RGB LEDs are NeoPixels.  Adafruit has a very good library for using them. If you would
 * like to experiment with features not supported by the ExoNaut library you can used the 
 * Adafruit NeoPixel library.  There are six LEDs and they are on pin 23.

 * Commands:
 * exonaut robot;                           //This command sets up the exonaut robot object.  exonaut is the class and robot is the name of the object.
 *                                          //This is the object that handles all of the motor commands and the features on the CoreX controller.
 * 
 * robot.begin();                           //This command initializes or begins the things in the robot object.
 *                                          //It is used once at the beginning of the program.
 * 
 * robot.setColor(pixel-num, red, green, blue);     //This command sets the color of one of the RGB LEDs in memory
 *                                                  //You must call robot.show() to activate changes to the RGB colors.
 * 
 * robot.setColorAll(red, green, blue);     //This command sets the RGB values for all six LEDs and automatically 
 *                                          //calls the robot.show() command.
 *
 * robot.show();                            //This command makes the RGB LEDs show the colors set in their memory.
 *
 * robot.clear();                           //This command clears all RGB LEDs and turns them off.
