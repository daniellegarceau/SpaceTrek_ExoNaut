 * Commands:
 * exonaut robot;                           //This command sets up the exonaut robot object.  exonaut is the class and robot is the name given to the object
 *                                          //This is the object that handles all of the motor commands and the features on the CoreX controller.
 * 
 * robot.begin();                           //This command initializes or begins the things in the robot object.
 *                                          //It is used once at the beginning of the program
 * 
 * robot.set_motor_speed(left, right);      //This command sets both motor speeds.  It takes integer numbers for the left and right parameters.
 *                                          //Positive numbers will make the motor move forward, negative numbers will make it move backwards.
 * 
 * robot.stop_motors(motorID);              //This command stops the motors.
 *                                          //MotorID 0 is both motors, motorID 1 is the left, and motorID 2 is the right.
 *
 * ultrasonic us;                           //This command sets up the ultrasonic us object. ultrasonic is the class and us is the name given to the object
 *                                          //This is the object that handles all of the ultrasonic distance sensor features
 *
 * us.getDistance()                         //This command returns the distance from an object detected by the sensor in mm
